      Hello, thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. I am Joshua
      Bergman, a frontend developer with full stack experience. As a developer I
      strive to create minimalistic, clean, and intuitive apps. While I
      specialize in the MERN stack I enjoy using and learning about new
      technologies and the utility they can enable.

        My passion for technology, and more specifically programming started as
        a child after learning to create mods for Minecraft. Ever since learning
        how to customize mods I have been hooked on programming, as I realized
        it was as much about engineering as anything else.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutMeP">
        I've always enjoyed the engineering process, as in: designing something,
        building it out, improving it, building it again but better. I apply
        this methodology to almost every aspect of my life, my hobbies also
        reflect this process of always improving, such as: woodworking, cars,
        gaming, and fitness. Although I enjoy trying new things, so I'm always
        adding to the list.
