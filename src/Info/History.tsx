      Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm Joshua Bergman. I like
      dogs and cows. I'm passionate about software that has a very clear value
      and enhances people's lives and saves them time.

      <p className="aboutMeP">
        Over the past two years, I've been dedicated to honing my developer
        skills, which has led me to successfully tackle several large-scale
        projects, build multiple tools used on a daily basis, and saved time by
        creating automation scripts. Additionally, I've completed two freelance
        projects, including a company site for a local frame shop.

      <p className="aboutMeP">
        My journey into software began in my childhood, when I started creating
        mods for Minecraft. This early experience sparked my passion for
        programming, which I've come to see as both an art and an engineering
        discipline.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutMeP">
        Speaking of engineering I've always had an affinity for the engineering
        process, whether it's designing, building, improving, or starting fresh
        with a better version. I apply this approach not only to my work but
        also to my hobbies, which includes cars, gaming, fishing, kayaking,
        traveling, fitness, and living a healthy(ish) lifestyle.
