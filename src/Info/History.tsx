        Over the past two years, I've been dedicated to honing my developer
        skills, which has led me to successfully tackle several large-scale
        projects, build multiple tools used on a daily basis, and saved time by
        creating automation scripts. Additionally, I've completed two freelance
        projects, including a company site for a local frame shop.

        I've been into tech my entire life, I even built my first computer
        single-handedly as a 10 year old! My passion for programming also began
        in my childhood, when I started creating mods for Minecraft. This early
        experience sparked my passion for software when I started to see the
        near infinite potential of what can be solved using tech.

        Outside of tech, I enjoy many hobbies, such as: cars, guitar, fitness,
        and the outdoors. I also love animals, such as my dog, a Bichon Frise,
