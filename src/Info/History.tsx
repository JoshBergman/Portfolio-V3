        Over the past year, I've been dedicated to honing my developer skills,
        which has led me to successfully tackle several large-scale projects.
        Additionally, I've completed a freelance project and numerous side
        projects, showcasing my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver
        innovative solutions.

      <p className="aboutMeP">
        My journey into technology and programming began in my childhood, when I
        started creating mods for Minecraft. This early experience sparked my
        enduring love for programming, which I've come to see as both an art and
        an engineering discipline.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutMeP">
        I've always had an affinity for the engineering process, whether it's
        designing, building, improving, or starting fresh with a better version.
        I apply this approach not only to my work but also to my hobbies, which
        include woodworking, automotive projects, gaming, and maintaining a
        healthy lifestyle. I'm always eager to explore new interests and expand
        my horizons.
